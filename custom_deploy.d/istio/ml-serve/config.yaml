      # but we override the list to:
      # 1) Change the default service type from LoadBalancer to NodePort
      # 2) Add fixed nodePort configurations (easier to configure LVS endpoints).
      # 3) Remove config for port 80 since it is not needed. This option has been
      #    temporarily re-enabled to ease testing.
      # 4) Add replicas to istio pods since we don't have autoscaling enabled
      #    (needs a metrics server etc..).
      # Please note that Istio needs specific Gateway, VirtualHost, Routes, etc..
      # configs to implement a L7 reverse proxy, and those needs to be configured
      # separately. In the Kubeflow use case, Knative-serving takes care of these
      # configurations (see the related helm chart).
