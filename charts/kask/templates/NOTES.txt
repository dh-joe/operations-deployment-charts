SERVICE_PORT=$(kubectl get svc --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} {{ template "wmf.releasename" . }} -o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[0].nodePort}')

or alternatively in your browser using the following URL

{{ if .Values.subcharts.cassandra }}
You 've specified that you 'd like to have cassandra populated as well. This
should only happen in a development environment, as we rely on
incubator/cassandra Helm subchart which will not work in production. There will
be a best-effort to populate a cassandra database and create keyspaces and
tables kask relies on. DO NOT CHANGE THE DEFAULTS FOR KEYSPACE!
