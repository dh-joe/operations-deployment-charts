# This file is not shipped by the Knative serving upstream code,
# it is specific to the WMF set up that the ML team is trying to use.
# Since we don't have a specific chart for Istio Gateway/VS/etc.. configs,
# and since Knative ships with Istio-specific configurations, this chart
# seems the best place to add extra Egress gateway configurations.
# In the future the code/configs below may be moved elsewhere.
#
# For every service that we want to proxy via the proxy sidecar, we need to
# define:
# 1) A ServiceEntry resource that establish what endpoints can be reached from
#     within the mesh.
# 2) A VirtualService resource that implements basic L7 routing rules.
# 3) A DestinationRule resource that establish how/if traffic is split
#    between multiple backends following a certain versioning.
#    For example, we could have two different versions of the same endpoint
#    and route part of the traffic to one and part to the other one, based
#    on some logic. For egress we don't really need it but we have to specify
#    a basic entry to make everything working.
