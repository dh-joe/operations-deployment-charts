This is the mediawiki-common chart, installing common elements of the
mediawiki-chart.

To use it, add a second release to the namespace where you're running
MediaWiki, and add a values file allowing you to override what you have defined
in mediawiki itself.

For instance, if you want to add a shared networkpolicy, you can add a release
called `common` and add a `values-common.yaml` file containing:

mw:
  networkpolicy:
    selectors:
      app: mediawiki
  feature_flags:
    cli:
      networkpolicy: true (# set this to false in the other releases)
