This chart was created to support charts that needs to create Secrets in a more
flexible way than what we provide in the scaffold directory.

The current use case is the Istio / Knative-serving one: we configure Istio via
istioctl (so outside helmfile/helm) and its L7 settings, including HTTPS
configuration and routing, are delegated to Knative. Upstream suggests the
following:
https://knative.dev/docs/serving/using-a-tls-cert/#manually-adding-a-tls-certificate
The caveat is that Knative serving needs to be able to create a TLS Secret in
the `istio-system` namespace (in order to allow the Istio gateway pod to load it).
The idea to solve this problem is to provide a separate `secrets` chart that
will be added as dependency of the Knative serving one, targeting the `istio-system`
namespace.
