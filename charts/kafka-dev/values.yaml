# If using minikube, you can connect to kafka from your host at $(minikube ip):30092.
# If using docker-desktop with kubernetes, you can connect at localhost:30092


# This port should be used for other internal kubernetes clients
kafka_internal_port: 9092

# This port should be used for external clients.
kafka_external_port: 30092

# This host should be used for external clients.
#
# If using minikube:
#   - set kafka_advertised_host to the value of $(minikube ip).
#   - Kafka clients can connect to $(minikube ip):<kafka_external_port>
#
# If using minikube on MacOS with Docker Desktop, you're going to have port forward.
#   - set kafka_advertised_host to 127.0.0.1
#   - kubectl port-forward svc/kafka-external <kafka_external_port>
#   - Kafka clients can connect to 127.0.0.1:<kafka_external_port>
#   NOTE: using 127.0.0.1 instead of 'localhost' is probably necessary.  Your
#   host machine needs to use the exact same IP address for localhost as
#   as the Kafka container does, and localhost may sometimes resolve to an IPv6 address.
kafka_advertised_host: 127.0.0.1

# Internal clients should connect to
#   kafka.{{ .Release.Namespace }}.svc.cluster.local:<kafka_internal_port>
#
# External clients should connect to
#   <kafka_advertised_host>:<kafka_external_port>.
