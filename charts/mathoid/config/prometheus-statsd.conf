# This file should contain the prometheus-statsd-exporter configuration
# For reference on how to write it, see
# https://github.com/prometheus/statsd_exporter/blob/master/README.md
#
# You can map your statsd metrics to prometheus ones, by mapping the hierarchical
#  names you get for statsd into prometheus labels; so say you have a metric
# called serviceA.dcA.serverA.endpoints.foobar.time   and you want to transform
# it to a metrics called "mean_response_time" with labels
#  {service: serviceA, datacenter: dcA, host: serverA, endpoint: foobar} you
# need to create a mapping as follows:
#
#  mappings:
#    - match: serviceA.*.*.endpoints.*.mean_response_time
#      name: "mean_response_time"
#      labels:
#        service: $1
#        datacenter: $2
#        host: $3
#        endpoint: $4
mappings:
  - match: mathoid.gc.*
    name: 'mathoid_gc_${1}_duration'

  - match: mathoid.heap.*
    name: 'mathoid_heap_${1}'

  - match: '^mathoid\.(.*)\.([A-Z].*)\.([0-9A][0-9Lx][0-9Lx])$'
    match_type: regex
    name: mathoid_requests_duration
    labels:
      uri: $1
      method: $2
      status: $3
