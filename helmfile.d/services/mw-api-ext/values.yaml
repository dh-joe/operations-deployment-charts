# When ramping up replicas in the main release, please remember

# We aim for ~3% of the deployment for canaries, rounding up.

  # March 2025 sizing for *multi-DC* serving:
  #replicas: 220
  # T383845 - With 100% of cookie-enrolled external traffic routed to PHP 8.1,
  # the next release has subsumed ~ 30% of peak traffic directed main.
  # Scale main to 80% of the 220 replica sizing (10% headroom):
  #replicas: 198
  # T383845 - Direct 25% of traffic of remaining to the migration release, by
  # swapping 50 replicas from main to migration:
  replicas: 148
  #####################################################
  # March 2025 estimated sizing for *single-DC* serving:
  #replicas: 260
  # T383845 - Using the same allocation as above, with some traffic directed to
  # next (i.e., 80% of 260 replicas):
  #replicas: 208
