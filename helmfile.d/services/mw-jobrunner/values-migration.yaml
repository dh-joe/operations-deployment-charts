# This release exists to enable incremental capacity-based traffic migration,
# and will initially be used to support migration to PHP 8.1.

# Incrementally exchange capacity between this and the "main" release in order
# to actuate the migration.
resources:
  # T383845 - Serve ~ 25% of traffic on PHP 8.1 (main: 105 migration: 35)
  replicas: 0

# TODO: T383845 - Temporarily increase maxUnavailable (6% default).
strategy:
  rollingUpdate:
    maxUnavailable: 20%

# Override local cluster name (defaults to namespace) to disambiguate in
# tracing and envoy metrics.

    service_name: mw-jobrunner-migration

# Do not create a distinct service, instead routing via the main release.
