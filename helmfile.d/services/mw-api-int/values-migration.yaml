# This release exists to enable incremental capacity-based traffic migration,
# and will initially be used to support migration to PHP 8.1.

# Incrementally exchange capacity between this and the "main" release in order
# to actuate the migration.
resources:
  # T383845 - Serve ~ 5% of traffic on PHP 8.1 (main: 247 migration: 13)
  replicas: 13

# TODO: T383845 - Temporarily increase maxUnavailable. Needs revised down as
# the deployment grows.
strategy:
  rollingUpdate:
    maxUnavailable: 20%

# Override local cluster name (defaults to namespace) to disambiguate in
# tracing and envoy metrics.
mesh:
  tracing:
    service_name: mw-api-int-migration

# Do not create a distinct service, instead routing via the main release.
service:
  deployment: none
routed_via: main
