# This release exists to enable incremental capacity-based traffic migration,
# and will initially be used to support migration to PHP 8.1.

# Incrementally exchange capacity between this and the "main" release in order
# to actuate the migration.
resources:
  # T383845 - Serve 5% of traffic on PHP 8.1 (main: 223 migration: 12)
  # NOTE: There is no need to adjust this for single-DC serving. For
  # simplicity, we will only scale up main and next.
  replicas: 12

# TODO: T383845 - Temporarily increase maxUnavailable (6% default).
strategy:
  rollingUpdate:
    maxUnavailable: 20%

# Override local cluster name (defaults to namespace) to disambiguate in
# tracing and envoy metrics.
mesh:
  tracing:
    service_name: mw-web-migration

# Do not create a distinct service, instead routing via the main release.

  deployment: none
